# Traffic Management System

## Overview
The Traffic Management System is designed to optimize traffic flow at road intersections by analyzing vehicle density and dynamically adjusting traffic signal timings. The system aims to reduce congestion and minimize vehicle waiting time.

## Features
- Vehicle density analysis for each lane
- Dynamic traffic signal timing
- Traffic flow optimization using algorithms
- Simulation of different traffic scenarios

## Tech Stack
- Programming Language: C++ / Python
- Concepts Used: Data Structures, Algorithms

## How It Works
1. Traffic data is taken as input or simulated.
2. Vehicle density is calculated for each direction.
3. Traffic signal timing is adjusted based on congestion.
4. Optimized signal control improves traffic flow.

## Future Improvements
- Integration with real-time traffic sensors
- Machine learning-based traffic prediction
- Live traffic monitoring dashboard
