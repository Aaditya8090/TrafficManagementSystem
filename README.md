Traffic Management System

📌 Overview
The Traffic Management System is designed to optimize traffic flow at intersections by analyzing vehicle density and dynamically managing traffic signals. The goal is to reduce congestion, waiting time, and improve overall traffic efficiency.

✨ Features
-> Vehicle density analysis for traffic lanes
-> Dynamic signal timing based on traffic conditions
-> Simulation of multiple traffic scenarios
->Efficient decision-making using algorithms

🛠️ Tech Stack
Programming Language: C++ / Python
Concepts Used: Data Structures, Algorithms

🚀 How It Works
-> Traffic data is collected or simulated for each lane.
-> Vehicle density is calculated.
-> Signal duration is adjusted dynamically based on congestion.
-> Optimized signal timings help reduce traffic delays.

📈 Future Improvements
-> Integration with real-time sensors and IoT devices
-> Machine Learning-based traffic prediction
-> Live traffic dashboard
